# Unibit_Assessments
# Array Combination and Merging

This program takes an array of integers and a target value as input. It finds pairs of integers in the array that sum up to the target value and returns them as a 2D array. Then, it merges the arrays and sorts them in ascending order. In the next step, it doubles the target value and finds combinations of digits (which can be multiple digits) that equal the double target value and returns them as a 2D array.

## Sample Input

Array: [1, 3, 2, 2, -4, -6, -2, 8]
Target Value: 4

## Output

First Combination For "4":
- [1, 3]
- [2, 2]
- [-4, 8]


Merge Into a single Array:
- [-6, -4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8]

Second Combination For "8":
- [1, 3, 2, 2]
- [8, -4, 2, 2]
- ...
- [n, n, n, n]

## Instructions

1. Compile and run the Java code using a Java compiler.
2. Enter the size of the array and the array elements.
3. Enter the target value.
4. The program will display the first combination, merged array, and second combination as output.

Feel free to modify the input array and target value to explore different combinations.
